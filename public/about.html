            Passionate Full-Stack Developer & Problem Solver

          <p>
            Welcome to my digital space! I'm a dedicated programmer who loves
            turning complex problems into elegant solutions. With a passion for
            clean code and innovative thinking, I strive to create applications
            that make a real difference in people's lives.

      <!-- My Story Section -->

        <h2><i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> My Story</h2>
        <p>
          My journey into programming began during high school, when I was
          introduced to coding by my cousin—a skilled software developer. He
          showed me how websites are built and what could be achieved through
          code. I was immediately fascinated and asked him to teach me the
          basics. That early exposure sparked a passion that has only grown
          stronger over time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Driven by curiosity, I began self-learning through online courses and
          tutorials, diving deep into web development and computer science
          fundamentals. I soon realized that this wasn’t just a hobby—it was the
          career path I wanted to pursue. That decision led me to enroll in the
          Computer Science & Technology Diploma program at Langara College in
          Canada.
        </p>

        <p>
          While advancing academically, I also explored the world of business. I
          built and managed several dropshipping stores and learned the ins and
          outs of digital marketing, Facebook Ads, sales strategy, and client
          communication. These experiences shaped me not only as a developer,
          but also as a communicator, problem solver, and entrepreneur.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the years, I’ve had the privilege to work on a wide range of
          technical projects—from responsive websites to complex backend
          systems, mobile applications, AI experiments, and even open-source
          contributions. Each project challenged me to grow and reinforced my
          belief in continuous learning and innovation.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I’m not writing code, I’m likely reading about emerging tech,
          collaborating with fellow developers, or mentoring others who are just
          starting their journey. I believe in community, collaboration, and
          building technology that creates real impact in people’s lives.
